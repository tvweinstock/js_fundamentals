// Exercises: Arrays

// EXERCISE: Your top choices

// Create an array to hold your top choices (colors, presidents, whatever).
// For each choice, log to the screen a string like: "My #1 choice is blue."
// Bonus: Change it to log "My 1st choice, "My 2nd choice", "My 3rd choice", picking the right suffix for the number based on what it is


var topColors = ['red', 'blue', 'aubergine', 'cyan', 'azure'];
console.log('My favorite color is ' + topColors[0]);
console.log('My 2nd choice is ' + topColors[1]);
console.log('My 3rd choice is ' + topColors[2]);
console.log('My final favorite is ' + topColors[3]);
